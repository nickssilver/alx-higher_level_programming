# Higher-level programming - Python, JavaScript, SQL
<hr/>
This repo contains all the projects that I have done in the alx-Holberton curriculum on Higher level programming.

## What Does High-Level Language (HLL) Mean?
A high-level language is any programming language that enables development of a program in a much more user-friendly programming context and is generally independent of the computer's hardware architecture.

A high-level language has a higher level of abstraction from the computer, and focuses more on the programming logic rather than the underlying hardware components such as memory addressing and register utilization.
